# UTR-CODE

## Overview
Translation is a fundamental biological process that directly influences protein abundance, yet the mechanisms by which mRNA sequences determine translational regulation remain incompletely understood, especially the 5â€™ untranslated regions (5' UTRs) play an essential role in translation regulation. Here, we generated 1,586 paired RNA-seq and Ribo-seq datasets from six species and developed a deep learning model UTR-CODE, to predict mRNA translation efficiency (TE). UTR-CODE demonstrates strong cross-species generalizability and outperforms existing tools across diverse platforms. 

## Environment
To set up the environment, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python=3.8.20
- torch=2.4.1
- CUDA=12.1  
- numpy=1.24.4
- pandas=2.0.3  
- scipy=1.10.1
- tqdm=4.67.1 
- pyarrow=17.0.0 

The required dependency packages will be automatically downloaded the first time you run the program.

## **Installation and Usage**

You can create a new conda environment using the following command:

```
conda create -n UTR-CODE python=3.8
```

Activate the environment:

```
conda activate UTR-CODE
```

### **UTR-CODE Model**

Download the necessary **.whl** file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Yyl8uUbjQn0TAA4E52ZUGBd_pb_RyW8/view?usp=sharing) and install it using:

```
pip install utr_code-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

To perform local training, use the following command:

```
utr-code-train --epochs 10
```
Here, epochs represents the number of training rounds, the default value is 10.

After the training is completed, the training weights will be saved in the current directory.
